# RouteNet

RouteNet is a neural architecture for network performance evaluation first proposed in the paper 

*Unveiling the potential of GNN for network modeling and optimization in SDN* by K. Rusek, J. Suárez-Varela, A. Mestres, P. Barlet-Ros, A. Cabellos-Aparicio accepted for ACM Symposium on SDN Research, April 2019, San Jose, CA, USA. [arXiv:1901.08113](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08113). 

An extended version of the model is presented in the paper *RouteNet: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for network modeling and optimization in SDN*
Krzysztof Rusek, José Suárez-Varela, Paul Almasan, Pere Barlet-Ros, Albert Cabellos-Aparicio [arXiv:1910.01508](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01508).

## Dataset
Datasets used for training are available at [KDN website](https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/NetworkModelingDatasets/tree/master/datasets_v1)
For training simulation, data must be converted to TFrecords using `upcdataset.py` script.
