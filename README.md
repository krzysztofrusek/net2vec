# net2vec

This repository is a collection of machine learning models for computer networks.
Currently, the following models are implemented:

1. [Message Passing](mpnn)- vanilla Graph Neural Network
1. [RouteNet](routenet) - A new neural architecture designed for neural understanding of routing in the network.
1. [Routing by Backprop](routing_by_backprop) - Differentiable surrogate for Dijkstra algorithm.

Queuing theory baselines used in many of the papers refered here are developed in a seperate reposity [queuinx](https://github.com/krzysztofrusek/queuinx)

**If you decide to apply the concepts presented or base on the provided code, please do refer our related paper**
