# net2vec

This repository is a collection of machine learning models for computer networks.
Currently, the following models are implemented:

1. [Message Passing](mpnn)- vanilla Graph Neural Network
1. [RouteNet](routenet) - A new neural architecture designed for neural understanding of routing in the network.
1. [Routing by Backprop](routing_by_backprop) - Differentiable surrogate for Dijkstra algorithm.
